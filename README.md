## Acknowledgment

We thank the authors and contributors of TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch and other DL platforms, and other DLearners. The name "Zeras" is a variant from Keras. We use "Z" because it makes the direcory Zeras/ always display in the last (or first) and do not intersect other directories.
